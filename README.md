# Predicting-Next-Day-Average-Temperature-in-Seoul-Using-Machine-Learning

# Purpose

This project aims to design and implement a regression model that accurately predicts the next-day average temperature in Seoul, South Korea. Accurate temperature prediction has significant implications for various sectors, including agriculture, transportation, and public safety.

# Background

Weather prediction, especially temperature forecasting, is critical for planning and decision-making across different domains. Traditional methods rely on complex physical models that simulate atmospheric conditions. However, with advancements in machine learning, there is an opportunity to leverage historical data to predict weather outcomes with high accuracy and potentially faster computation times. This project seeks to harness these advancements to create a reliable regression model for temperature prediction.

# Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Exploration and Understanding**:
    - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics and distributions of the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Handle missing values and outliers.
    - Normalize or standardize the features as necessary.
3. **Feature Selection**:
    - Select relevant features for the regression analysis.
4. **Model Development**:
    - Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression.
    - Train and validate the model using a portion of the dataset.
    - Test the model's performance on a separate dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the model's accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).

# Best Model and Learning Curve

To determine the best model and evaluate its performance, the following steps were taken:

1. **Model Selection**:
    - Various regression algorithms were considered, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and others.
2. **Training and Validation**:
    - The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
    - Models were trained on the training set and validated using cross-validation techniques.
3. **Performance Evaluation**:
    - The model's performance was evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R².
